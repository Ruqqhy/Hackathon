This proect as done on a sales marketing dat set in which the company wanted to figure out which marketing strategy works best 
for promoting their products

Sales is what the media stratgies were used against 
Even thou our focus was on visualization we did exploratory data analysis to help us understand our data better
And also be ale to tell a story out of it
